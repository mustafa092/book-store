### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mustafa092/book-store.git`
2. Open the backend solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Set the API project as the startup project and build it (`Ctrl+Shift+B`).
4. Run the project (`F5`). Ensure it's running on port `44359`. If not, adjust the frontend's `environment.ts`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. In the frontend directory, run `npm install` to get `node_modules`.
3. In `environment.ts`, set `apiUrl` to `http://localhost:YOUR_BACKEND_PORT` if the backend port differs.
4. Start the application with `ng serve`.

## Usage 💡

With both servers running, access the frontend at `http://localhost:4200` to interact with your application.
